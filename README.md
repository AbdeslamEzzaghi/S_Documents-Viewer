# URL Modifier Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that automatically modifies Scribd document URLs to embed URLs.

## Description

This extension takes the current URL of a Scribd document and transforms it into an embed URL. For example, `https://www.scribd.com/document/543081123/fiches-pedagogiques` becomes `https://www.scribd.com/embeds/543081123/content`. This can be particularly useful for embedding Scribd documents into web pages or for other purposes.

## Features

- Automatically captures the current Scribd document URL from the active tab.
- Transforms the URL to its embed form.
- Opens the modified URL in a new tab.
